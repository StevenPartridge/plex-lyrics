Welcome to the Plex Lyrics Auto Clicker, your new best friend for non-stop singing sessions!

We all love the Plex Music player, but having to manually open the lyrics each time a song changes can be a real buzzkill. This limitation exists due to the costs associated with fetching lyrics for every track. But don't worry, we've got you covered!

With the Plex Lyrics Auto Clicker, a nifty Firefox extension, you can enjoy seamless lyrics display without lifting a finger. Whether you're belting out tunes at your desk or leading a karaoke party, this extension ensures the lyrics are always on screen for at least a few songs in a row.

The extension features an intuitive interface to start and stop the automation, and you can even set a timer for how long you want the magic to last. So, get ready to sing your heart out without interruptions!
